Proposal: Docs & names for game assets
======================================


This directory holds two subdirectories:
* levels (with one subdirectory per level)
* cars (with one subdirectory per car)

Each level is defined by 
* one json-file (level.json)
* one subdirectory for source files e.g. blend files (this directory can be ignored)
* 4 level images (background.png, foreground.png, z.png and drivable.png)
	* background.png is used as background layer to display the level for the user
	  (only visual)
	* foreground is used above the background layer 
	  (only visual)
	* z.png provides a hight map of the level which can be used to scale the cars
	  (not displayed, but used for game logic)
	  (black=low, white=high) 
	* drivable.png provides the area for movement for the cars.
	  (white = full speed is possible, black = only very slow movement is possible)

Cars drive between background and foreground layer of the levels.


Each car is defined by
* one json-file (car.json)
* one subdirectory for source files e.g. blend files (this directory can be ignored)
* two png files (fixed-color.png, playercolor.png) that together show the car
  if both are displayed (playercolor.png over fixed-color.png), the car is ready.
	* fixed-color.png is a sprite that can be displayed without changes
	* playercolor is a sprite that can be customized for different player colors


The default size of levels is 1600x1200  (can be re-defined in level.json)
The default size of levels is 64x32  (can be re-defined in level.json)
