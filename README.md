Lecture Hall Games
==================

Lecture Hall Games is a simple collection of games (currently only the car
racer game is available) that can be played on any PC with an arbitrary number
of players. Each player needs to a) be able to see the screen (a video
projector is preferable) and b) a custom android app that connects over Wifi
and acts as controller.
